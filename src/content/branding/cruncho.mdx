Cruncho is a platform that lets restaurants, cafes, pubs and hotels manage their orders, payments, bookings and more. It's since been rebranded as diinr.

You can visit the website at [https://diinr.com](https://diinr.com).

## Why the name?
I thought this over for multiple months and finally settled on cruncho, it's a `sound` that people make when eating food "crunch" and then to keep it playful and lighthearted I decided to add the `o` to it.

## Logo ideation
I designed the logo for cruncho in the early days of the company, I wasn't sure what the logo would look like, so I designed it in a sketchbook and then I sent it to my friends and family to get feedback. they were very helpful and gave me some great feedback.

Through the ideation process, I landed on the logo that's shown above, crunch with a round, geometric typeface and the `o` in the shape of a perfect donut, with a `bite` taken out the top right corner of it.
Where the word mark is the full word cruncho, and the `o` is the logo mark.

## Colour choices
I decided to go with a purple/blue colour for the primary colour and a eco-green for the secondary colour, with accents being a more vibrant purple, orange and pink. 
With the black and white colours being slightly off black/white respectively.
