# Welcome to the Example Project

This project demonstrates how to style various markdown elements using the Tailwind CSS Typography plugin.

## Subheading Level 2

This is a **subheading**. Below are different types of elements and how they can be styled:

### Subheading Level 3

1. **Ordered List Item 1:** This is an example of an ordered list item.
2. **Ordered List Item 2:** Another item in the ordered list.

- **Unordered List Item 1:** This is an example of an unordered list item.
- **Unordered List Item 2:** Another item in the unordered list.

### Blockquote Example

> This is a blockquote. Blockquotes are used to highlight quotes from other texts or emphasize a particular point.

### Code Example

Here&apos;s a block of code:

```js
console.log("Hello, world!");
```

Inline code looks like this: `const example = true;`

### Images
