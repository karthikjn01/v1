Diinr is the rebranded version of Cruncho, a platform that lets restaurants, cafes, pubs and hotels manage their orders, payments, bookings and more.

You can visit the website at [https://diinr.com](https://diinr.com).

## Why the name?
As we started to get customers, we needed the company to be registered, unfortunately cruncho was already trademarked and so we couldn't use cruncho and so the hunt for a new name began.

</div>

## Colour choices
We decided to stick with the original colours, however adjust the logo to be more enterprise ready, less colour, more corporate. We have a purple/blue logo mark and the text is in black. We also didn't want to seem too corporate so we decided to use a funky typeface (TRAP*).
