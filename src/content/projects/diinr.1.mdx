# DIINR
Hi there. This is DIINR. DIINR is a platform that lets restaurants, cafes, pubs and hotels manage their orders, payments, bookings and more.
You can visit the website at [https://diinr.com](https://diinr.com).

## Why did I build this?
I was once at a restaurant that had a QR code on the table that you could scan to pay for your meal. However, it was missing basic features such as being able to order via a digital menu, leave tips, feedback etc.
I thought, if a company (which I later found out has 125M in funding) can build a platform that does half a job, why not build one that does all of it? And so, diinr was born.

## Hello World (dinofork)
(Try not to judge me, I needed a placeholder). Whenever I start a new project, I need to start with a name, brand and an `idea`. I decided to start with the name, `dinofork`. Don't even ask me why, it's just a placeholder.
Anyways, the actual product started off as just being a place for owners to get a digital menu. I had just built an `MVP`. In my opinion it was a good start, but it wasn't something that people would use, or even more so, pay for. 
So I continued to build the product and develop more features.

## Hello World (Cruncho) 
(Okay, this is a bit better) - Now Cruncho is a bit of a nicer name, slightly more professional and a bit more captivating.
The brand and the logo that came along with it was also quite nice too, a massive improvement over `dinofork`. Anyways, the actual product was massively more developed.
You can now setup mutliple restaurants, with multiple menus and can take orders and payments. Everything on there is synchronised across all the members.
Payments were a bit fidely but that's a story for another day. So we had a product we could sell. I started going around to restaurants and seeing what they had to think about it.
There was a lot of feedback but for the most part it was not good. The restaurants just weren't interested in it, they had bad experiences in the past or they didn't see the benefits.
Even more so, the price that we had (due to the fact that we were a startup) wasn't good enough for restaurants to take payments through us. Restaurants were looking for closer to 0.8% but due to the lack of customers and volume discounts, the best we could offer was closer to 2.5%.
Anyways, we kept going with it and we kept getting feedback. We kept improving the product and we kept getting feedback.

## Glimmer of Hope
A friend of mine introduced me to a hotel chain, that had ~30 hotels in the UK and London, they were looking for a QR code system that they could place in each room to let customers order room service or other amenities.
We demoed the product and they thought it was fantastic, but then they stopped communications, I figured they were busy or weren't interested, so I kept developing the product.
I kept nudging them to get in touch and after around 2 months they finally got back to me. Unfortunately, they had `magicked` up a QR code system built in house that had all the same features that cruncho had.
This was a gut punch for me. However, I like to think that everything has a silver lining, and I'm glad that I was able to learn from this experience.

I reframed the way I was thinking about this situation and my thought process switched from "They stole my idea and built it themselves" to "They validated my idea and proved it would work".
At this point I still have 0 customers, 0 revenue and 0 profit. But I'm still convinced that this is a great idea and I'm going to keep working on it.

## Building a Team
For those who don't know me, I'm an avid badminton player and I play a *lot*, some would say too much. Thankfully, it means I have access to a lot of people (who'd have thought?).
I've been very fortunate to have bumped into the right people at the right time. Before I get into who I decided to bring on board, let me explain why I chose people I know instead of people I don't know.

In the early stages of a company, which is the stage we are in right now, I was looking for not only the best of the best but also the people who would be loyal to the company and provide immense value. 
I was looking for people who would be able to work with me, who would be able to help me grow and who would be able to provide me with the support I needed to succeed.

| Trust/Loyaly > Skills

And that's not to say that the people I bought onboard weren't skilled, quite the opposite, they are the best of the best.
I'm lucky to say I've got a team of 2 other people now, who are incredibly talented and I'm very lucky to have them on board.

## Another Hope
With the onboarding of the team, I was able to expand the reach of the product and finally get someone who was interested in giving it a go.
This posed a couple of challenges, firstly, we had to register the company, and unfortuantely there was another company that had the same name and had trademarked it.
This meant having to do a full rebrand and redesign of cruncho. This sounds like it would've been a lot of work, but relatively speaking it wasn't too bad, we were able to get the new name and brand setup within ~2 weeks and get everything migrated to the new design system.

## Introducing diinr

^ The new design and brand. The new logo, name and brand is diinr, pronounced like 'die-ner' or 'dee-inr'. It's a play on words, and you can say it how you'd like. The logo, you're probably wondering where that came from.
Well company logos, generally don't have the be representative of the company or product, more often than not should be symbolic instead. Think along the lines of pepsi, opentable, starbucks, slack, etc. All these logos are symbolic and iconic.

If you really want to attach meaning to the logo, you could consider the logo being a representation of a menu, or a table, or a weird square plate. Realistically if you squint hard enough you can make of it what you want.

## The Future
The future is bright, we're going to go beyond just taking orders and paying for them through diinr.
We're going to be able to setup multiple restaurants, with multiple menus and can take orders and payments and be a complete end to end system with booking, feedback management, marketing and much much more. Everything on there is synchronised across all the members.
We'll continue to improve the product and keep getting feedback, iterate quick and make things better. Our objective with the company is to change the way that the food industry works, take away the unfair practices enforced by big monopolies and provide the best options to the small-mid sized businesses.
Our primary mission is not to make the most money, we want to be sustainable ofcourse but we believe that making a difference is more important, and that's what we're going to do.
