# DIINR
Hi there. This is DIINR. DIINR is a platform that lets restaurants, cafes, pubs and hotels manage their orders, payments, bookings and more.
You can visit the website at [https://diinr.com](https://diinr.com).

## Why did I build this?
I was once at a restaurant that had a QR code on the table that you could scan to pay for your meal. However, it was missing basic features such as being able to order via a digital menu, leave tips, feedback etc.
I thought, if a company (which I later found out has 125M in funding) can build a platform that does half a job, why not build one that does all of it? And so, diinr was born.

## Hello World (dinofork)
(Try not to judge me, I needed a placeholder). Whenever I start a new project, I need to start with a name, brand and an `idea`. I decided to start with the name, `dinofork`. Don't even ask me why, it's just a placeholder.
Anyways, the actual product started off as just being a place for owners to get a digital menu. I had just built an `MVP`. In my opinion it was a good start, but it wasn't something that people would use, or even more so, pay for. 
So I continued to built the product and develop more features.

## Hello World (Cruncho) 
(Okay, this is a bit better) - Now Cruncho is a bit of a nicer name, slightly more professional and a bit more captivating.
The brand and the logo that came along with it was also quite nice too, a massive improvement over `dinofork`. Anyways, the actual product was massively more developed.
You can now setup mutliple restaurants, with multiple menus and can take orders and payments. Everything on there is synchronised across all the members.
Payments were a bit fidely but that's a story for another day.
